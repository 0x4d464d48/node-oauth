node-oauth
===========
A simple oauth API for node.js .  This API allows users to authenticate against OAUTH providers, and thus act as OAuth consumers

Tested against both Twitter (http://twitter.com) and term.ie (http://term.ie/oauth/example/)


Also provides rudimentary OAuth2 support, tested against facebook connect.
